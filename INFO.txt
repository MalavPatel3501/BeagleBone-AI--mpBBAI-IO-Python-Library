mpBBAI-IO

mpBBAI-IO is a Python module for using control IO pins on the BeagleBone AI.
There's lots of work still to be done. 

Some pheripharal example code based on mpBBAI-IO developed 
by Malav Vinodkumar Patel(Teksun Microsys Pvt Ltd): 

Project Detail:
Explain and given steps of Full Process for  Pin muxing for Beagle Bone AI Board(am5729-beagleboneai).
In this Project i developed Beagle Bone AI Python Library and individual module. you can import module/libarary and use it in your project.

Steps: 
1) Make customize .dts file,
2) Compile .dts file using make command,
3) Generate  .dtb file, 
4) Install .dtb file in boot directory, 
5) Update environment file

In This project i added header 8 and header 9 Pin with GPIO number mapping file and Pin with Register value file.
Moreover i given Beagle Bone AI System Reference Manual Link, also i explain all interface enable steps in Readme file.  
In additionally i given some example code so you can run,use it and test the interfaces/pin functionalities.
